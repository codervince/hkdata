He said he attempted to restrain ORIENTAL FANTASIA to steady the tempo as he was aware that the race was being run at a quick tempo.  He said despite his endeavours, ORIENTAL FANTASIA continued to over-race and would not settle with him even after assuming the outright lead near the 1000 Metres.

Before being allowed to race again, SUPER HORSE will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial.\nGOLD TARTINI was slow to begin.\nPassing the 1400 Metres, MY SURPLUS was directed in away from the heels of HAPPY KAISER (N Callan) which shifted in when not properly clear.  N Callan was reprimanded and advised to exercise more care.\nAfter the 700 Metres, LIBERAL OF MIND raced in restricted room between NAMJONG TURBO and CASA JUNIOR which shifted out.\nApproaching the 500 Metres, LIBERAL OF MIND was again awkwardly place between CASA JUNIOR and NAMJONG TURBO.\nAt the 400 Metres, CASA JUNIOR was steadied after being disappointed for running between MY SURPLUS and NAMJONG TURBO.  When attempting to improve between MY SURPLUS and NAMJONG TURBO, CASA JUNIOR bumped the hindquarters of NAMJONG TURBO which became unbalanced.\nWhen improving into tight running between ORIENTAL FANTASIA and HAPPY KAISER near the 300 Metres, HEAR THE ROAR then raced tight between those runners for some distance due to HAPPY KAISER shifting in marginally.\nOver the final 200 Metres, HEAR THE ROAR lay out under pressure.\nNear the 100 Metres, W M Lai, the rider of LIBERAL OF MIND, was obliged to stop riding his mount when crowded for room between THE ONLY KID and CASA JUNIOR which shifted out.\nWhen questioned, U Rispoli reported that he had been asked to lead on FOUR FOUR FIVE if possible as the horse had raced well when ridden in this manner at its most recent start which was a significant improvement on its previous form.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode FOUR FOUR FIVE along vigorously in the early stages in an attempt to lead, however, near the 1500 Metres it became apparent to him that ORIENTAL FANTASIA, which was positioned to the outside of FOUR FOUR FIVE, was travelling keenly and that FOUR FOUR FIVE would not be able to continue to contest the lead without him having to make considerable use of the horse.  He said as the tempo of the race at this time was strong, he elected to allow ORIENTAL FANTASIA to assume the lead and he had hoped to then shift to that horse\u2019s outside.  He said by the time it became available to him to shift to the outside of ORIENTAL FANTASIA, HAPPY KAISER was ridden along to the outside FOUR FOUR FIVE which prevented him from shifting the horse out.  He added when this occurred, FOUR FOUR FIVE immediately came off the bridle and then subsequently, despite being ridden along, finished tailed out.  A veterinary inspection of FOUR FOUR FIVE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of FOUR FOUR FIVE was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FOUR FOUR FIVE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.\nC Y Ho (ORIENTAL FANTASIA) advised that he had been instructed to attempt to lead as the horse had been consistently ridden in a forward position.  He said at no time during the early stages did he have to ride ORIENTAL FANTASTIA along to obtain a forward position as the horse travelled very strongly in the early and middle stages.  He said he attempted to restrain ORIENTAL FANTASIA to steady the tempo as he was aware that the race was being run at a quick tempo.  He said despite his endeavours, ORIENTAL FANTASIA continued to over-race and would not settle with him even after assuming the outright lead near the 1000 Metres.  He added because of the manner in which ORIENTAL FANTASIA travelled in the early and middle stages, the horse was then not able to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of ORIENTAL FANTASIA immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.\nHEAR THE ROAR, TELEPHATIA and NAMJONG TURBO were sent for sampling.\n<2/1/2015  Additional Veterinary Report>FOUR FOUR FIVE, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer.  He said at that time an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse\u2019s trachea.  FOUR FOUR FIVE was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer R Gibson this morning.  He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its left front leg.
